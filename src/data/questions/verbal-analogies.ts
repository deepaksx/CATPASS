    choices: ['Huge', 'Tiny', 'Short', 'Wide', 'Narrow'],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'Big and Large are synonyms (they mean the same thing). Similarly, Small and Tiny are synonyms. The strategy is to spot that both pairs share the same meaning — look for a word that means the same as the third word.',

    explanation: 'Happy and Joyful are synonyms. Similarly, Sad and Sorrowful are synonyms. When you see two words that mean the same thing, look for a choice that is a close synonym of the third word. "Upset" is tempting but is more general — Sorrowful specifically means full of sadness.',
