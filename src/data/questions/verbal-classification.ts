    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'Shark, Whale, and Dolphin all live in the sea — but look more carefully: Whale and Dolphin are marine mammals (they breathe air and feed milk to their young). Shark is a fish, so the broader link is marine animals. Seal is also a marine mammal that lives in the sea. Trout is freshwater, Frog is an amphibian, Penguin is a bird, and Otter mostly lives in rivers.',

    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation: 'Lizard, Snake, and Crocodile are all reptiles (cold-blooded, scaly skin, lay hard-shelled eggs). Tortoise is also a reptile, so it belongs with the group. This is a common trap: Frog, Newt, Salamander, and Toad are all amphibians, not reptiles. The key difference is that amphibians have moist skin and usually start life in water.',

    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'Rough, Coarse, and Bumpy all describe uneven or abrasive textures. Gritty also describes a rough, grainy texture, so it belongs with the group. Smooth, Soft, Silky, and Glossy all describe the opposite — even or pleasant textures.',

    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'Hail, Sleet, and Snow are all forms of frozen water that fall from the sky or form as ice. Frost is also frozen water (ice crystals that form on surfaces). Cloud, Wind, Fog, and Humidity involve moisture or air movement but are not frozen precipitation or ice.',

    explanation: 'Glass, Water, and Air are all transparent — you can see through them. Ice is also transparent (clear ice lets light pass through). Milk is opaque (white), and Wood, Paper, and Stone all block light. The trick is recognising the shared invisible property rather than focusing on whether they are solids, liquids, or gases.',

    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'Cork, Feather, and Pumice all float on water because they are less dense than water. Balsa wood is also extremely light and floats easily, so it belongs with the group. The surprise in the group is Pumice — it is a volcanic rock, but it is full of air pockets, which makes it the only rock that floats. Marble, Granite, Lead, and Iron are all dense and sink.',

This question has several traps: Pluto was reclassified as a dwarf planet in 2006, the Moon is a natural satellite (not a planet), the Sun is a star, and Ceres is a dwarf planet in the asteroid belt. The key is knowing the current list of eight planets.',
